## Linocut print. 2017

![yellow and orange linoleum block print of a tree branching with a burl in the center.](/assets/images/burl-print.png)

Single linoleum block relief print, created for a printmaking course at Grinnell College. I chose tree bark as a texture which would be compatible with the relief printing tools and techniques, and so a burl was the natural focal point. However, it reminded a lot of people of an orange.

In fact, this piece is similar to a fused glass bowl I made in 2014, which everyone also thought was reminiscent of an orange.
