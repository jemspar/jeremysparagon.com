Until recently, my mom had not expressed any interest in selling or showing her paintings. However, she's been painting for decades and has built up a large portfolio of work. After one of her paintings was shown in the De Young Museum's [Open Exhibition](https://deyoungopenexhibition.artcall.org/submissions/qr-view/167179), I decided to create a portfolio website so that anyone (potential buyers, gallerists, etc.) could find her work online.

First, I took photos of all her recent work, edited them so they would present well on the site, and then created the site using the Ember.js framework. The site is still in progress, as there are more paintings I still need to photograph, upload, and edit. ðŸ™‚
